I. Sneakers/Bicycle/Swimwear

1.1. Type
There are two types of Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear:
- Standard
- Branded

Sneakers
Let players participate in running or jogging.
There are four types of Sneakers. Each type is suitable for a Runner’s fitness and professionalism:
Sneakers - Speed (km/h) - Earning Rate
Beginner - 1-6 - Max 38 RUNGEM / 12 Energy
Jogger - 4-10 - Max 40 RUNGEM / 12 Energy
Runner - 8-20 - Max 42 RUNGEM / 12 Energy
Super Star - 10-20 - Max 38-44 RUNGEM / 12 Energy

Swimmer Pro - 1.5-3 - Max 42 RUNGEM / 12 Energy
Super Star - 2-4 - Max 38-44 RUNGEM / 12 Energy

1.2. Attributes
There are 5 attributes for each Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear, including:

Booster
“Booster” plays a part in RUNGEM earnings. Having a higher Booster Attribute will result in better RUNGEM earnings per ENERGY spent.

Prayer
“Prayer” will accumulate a percentage to receive a lucky box when playing the workout mode (only applies to Sneakers reaching Level 15 and above, consuming energy to receive the corresponding %).

Helper
“Helper” controls how long each NFT Sneakers lasts, the higher the helper score, the more days the Sneakers will be used. Duration will be consumed each day when you use the Sneakers, raise the Help as soon as possible.

Worker
“Worker” will help you repair damaged Sneakers, Higher Worker will lead to a slower drop in Durability. The higher the level or line of the Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear, the higher the repair cost.

Secreter
This stat only appears when the Character you buy is KOL Character.
(*) Secreter will be announced soon.

1.3. Rarity
There are five rarities of Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear. When a Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear is minted, the value of each Attribute will be chosen at random within the min. and max. values according to Sneakers quality. As such, even Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear of the same quality may have vastly different Attribute distributions.

Rarity - Min Base Attribute - Max Base Attribute
Nano - N/A - N/A
Mini - N/A - N/A
Common - 3 - 10
Rare - 8 - 18
Super Rare - 15 - 33
Epic - 28 - 61
Legendary - 50 - 111

1.4. Level
There are 30 levels of Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear (from Level 1 to Level 30). The level can be upgraded by using the feature “Upgrading”.

1.5. Durability
Durability is the “endurance” of the Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear, when the user uses it, the Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear will begin to fail.
If Sport NFTs are “broken”, the Booster ratio according to Durability is shown as follows:
Durability - Booster Percent
90-100 - 100%
80-89 - 50%
70-79 - 5%
40-69 - 2%
0-39 - 1%

1.6. Lifetime & Revival
(Using NFT) Reduce Lifetime Per Day = (System Value x Rarity)/(HP) + Z
Lifetime is the period of time during which the Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear is usable. Everyday, the User workouts, the Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear will depreciate to unusable. The lifespan of the Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear is 365 days.
Explanation:
Rarity: is the rarity of Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear. Each rarity has a different value point.
HP: is the total “Helper” Point of the Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear (In Use).
Z: is the “shield” of RUNGEM price! When the RUNGEM price is low, the Z number will increase to prevent coin inflation, then the lifetime will consume more and will quickly end the process of using NFT. Thanks to that, protect the coin price!
Condition (f) - Z Value
$2 =< RUNGEM - 0
$1.5 =< RUNGEM < $2 - 1
$1.0 =< RUNGEM < $1.5 - 2
$0.5 =< RUNGEM < $1 - 3
RUNGEM < $0.5 - 4

(Additional NFT in the Account) Reduce Lifetime Per Day = 2
User play “Workout/ PVP/ Mara Runnow” → Additional NFT in the account will be reduced by 2 “Lifetime” per day.
(Additional NFT in the Account) Reduce Lifetime Per Day = 2
If in the day (GMT 0 to GMT 24), users don’t play “Workout/ PVP/ Mara Runnow”, only play “Leaderboard” → All NFT in the account will not reduce “Lifetime”.
Reduce Lifetime Per Day will depend on “Helper” point, rarity, status in-game (Equipped or Not Equipped) of Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear, exchange ratio of BUSD/ RUNGEM and game mode.
(*) Details of Revival will be updated shortly.

1.7. General Note
Players can freely choose one of the sports of Running, Cycling, Swimming, or combining themselves as long as it is within the maximum health index of the day. Or you can practice more by buying Energy drinks, but we always recommend that you always prioritize proper health as the top priority, the practice needs to be developed regularly, not too much.
Factors affecting the results of running, cycling, and swimming:
GPS signal is not received, or GPS is intermittent
Ratio of random factors impact

II. Character

2.1. Type
There are two types of Character: 
- Standard
- KOL

Standard Character
When the user owns a Character, it will increase the stats that affect the Earning result compared to a normal Character.
(*) Some benefits will be updated later.

KOL Character
KOL Characters are special for players. There will be idols, celebrities, athletes, etc. that will transform into characters in Runnow.io to experience with users.
When a user owns a KOL Character, in addition to the usual Character effects, you have a few more important advantages:
- Become a KOL Fan on Runnow.io, have the opportunity to receive gifts from them or meet them directly through events (later update).
- Increased stats that affect Earning results compared to normal Character.
- Unlock an additional Secreter attribute on the participating sport.
(*) Some benefits will be updated later.

2.2. Attributes
There are 4 states: Unhappy - Tired - Normal - Happy corresponding to the Character’s status milestones.
When at the Happy level, the effect on the ability to earn RUNGEM is greater, similar to the lowest earning in Unhappy, and will have no effect if below this minimum.
Every 6 hours, the Character’s Happy stat will increase by one level, it will reach full happiness when 24 hours are complete.

2.3. Rarity
- Common
- Rare
- Super Rare
- Epic
- Legendary

2.4. Level
There are total 30 levels (from 1 to 30).

2.5. Health
When a Character participates in a sport that will drain the health stat corresponding to that Character’s rarity and level, the higher the level and rarity the more will be consumed because production affects earning the money more.
When health declines, it is necessary to take medicine to recover. Medicines are purchased with RUNGEM. If the Health stat decreases without being restored, the impact on Earning efficiency will also decrease.
Avoid letting the Health stat drop to 0, because then the Character will enter the “Dead” state, then it cannot affect the monetization process, and we have to replace it with a new Character.
Point range of health is from 0 to 100.

III. Statue & Gem

3.1. Statue
What is Statue?
Statue is the position on Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear where the Users can insert the corresponding Gem to boost their Sneakers/ Bicycle/ Swimwear attributes.

The higher Prayer attribute, the more likely it is to earn Gem Boxes, there will be 5 types of boxes corresponding to 5 different colors at random. After earning the Gem box the user can open the box to a random percentage of the Gem, and this time the user can use it to attach to the Statue or upgrade the Gem to a higher level or bring them to the Marketplace to sell to others.

There are five types of Gems, with each Gem representing an Attribute:

Yellow, Hermes, Booster
